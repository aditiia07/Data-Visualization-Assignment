## About the Assignment
Spanning 120 years of Olympic history, provides a comprehensive look at the modern Olympic Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. This dataset is a valuable resource for historical analysis, sports science research, sociological studies, and more, offering insights into the evolution of sports, the participation of nations over time, and the achievements of athletes across the globe. Its relevance is underscored by the inclusion of both Summer and Winter Games data, reflecting changes in the Olympic schedule that began in 1994 with the staggering of the Games to alternate every two years between Summer and Winter events.

The primary dataset, athlete_events.csv, with its 271,116 rows and 15 columns, encompasses detailed information about individual athletes and their performances in Olympic events. Each record includes the athlete's ID, name, sex, age, physical attributes (height and weight), team, National Olympic Committee (NOC) code, the Games' year and season, the host city, sport, specific event, and any medals won. This dataset is complemented by noc_regions.csv, which maps NOC codes to their respective countries or regions, providing additional context for analyzing athletes' national affiliations.
